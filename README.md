In particular, this toolbox contains the following features:

    KLT feature tracker (Tomasi-Kanade feature detector & Lucas-Kanade tracking)
    Optical flow from either KLT or image correlation (using the additional MatPIV toolbox)
    Bi-Orthogonal Decomposition of optical flow or tracked features
    A player to display all results
    A full set of user interfaces
